  faq_1_a: "Kal Mydas is a DeFi ecosystem offering 5 algorithmic gold (XAUUSD) trading strategies. Bots execute trades automatically, 24/7. Everything is transparent and verifiable on-chain (Base for mainnet, Arbitrum Sepolia for testnet).",
  faq_2_q: "What is the minimum deposit?",
  faq_2_a: "You can start with as little as $10 (in USDC on Base). There is no maximum amount. Your funds remain under your control in the smart contracts.",
  faq_3_q: "How do withdrawals work?",
  faq_3_a: "Withdrawals are free and instant, 24/7. No lock-up period, no withdrawal fees. You interact directly with the smart contract.",
  faq_4_q: "Is future performance guaranteed?",
  faq_4_a: "No. The figures shown are based on historical backtests (up to 21 years of data). Past performance does not guarantee future results. Trading involves risk of capital loss.",
  faq_5_q: "What are the fees?",
  faq_5_a: "No entry or exit fees. Performance fees of 10% to 20% depending on strategy, charged on new gains thanks to the High-Water Mark system. Annual management fees of 0% to 6% depending on the pool (ORION 0%, HORIZON 1.2%, VALKYRIE 2.4%, REVOLUTION 6%, TREASURY 6%).",
  faq_6_q: "Do I need a crypto wallet to use Kal Mydas?",
  faq_6_a: "No. You can sign in with a simple email or Google account. A wallet is created automatically for you through Privy. Advanced users can also connect their own wallet (MetaMask, etc.).",
  faq_7_q: "Are the contracts audited?",
  faq_7_a: "Yes. Three Omniscient Lab audits PASS (4.22, 4.23, 4.24) on the 23 core protocol contracts. KAL-001 through KAL-008 Codex findings are all resolved. Audit reports are public and accessible from the official documentation.",
  faq_8_q: "Which strategy should I choose as a beginner?",
  faq_8_a: "HORIZON is the most conservative profile, designed for discovery (modest simulated performance, controlled drawdown on backtest). VALKYRIE offers a balanced profile. The more aggressive strategies (REVOLUTION, TREASURY, ORION) require a clear understanding of volatility. You can pick several and split your capital as you wish.",
